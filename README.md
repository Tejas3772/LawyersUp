## How To Install
Create React App
Create React App
This directory is a brief example of a Create React App site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

Deploy Your Own
Deploy your own Create React App project with Vercel.


Live Example: https://create-react-template.vercel.app/

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
